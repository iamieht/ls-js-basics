// How can we access the element 'and' in the array ['fish', 'and', 'chips']?

const array1 = ["fish", "and", "chips"];
elementAnd = array1[1];
console.log(elementAnd);

// We can use bracket notation to access the array element at a particular index. In JavaScript, arrays have a zero-based index. This means that the first element in the array will have an index of 0, the second element will have an index of 1, and so on.
